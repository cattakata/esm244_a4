## Summary 
We will perform hierarchical clustering by site. First, we will make a data frame that has a single summary row per site (e.g. based on means from all observations at that site), then calculate the euclidean distance before performing complete linkage agglomerative hierarchical clustering. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# Packages for cluster analysis:
library(NbClust)
library(cluster)
library(factoextra)
library(dendextend)
library(ggdendro)
```


```{r}
# Read in data and convert -999 values to NA.
water_chem <- read.csv(here("data", "sbc_lter_registered_stream_chemistry.csv")) %>% 
  na_if(-999.0) %>% 
  clean_names()
```


```{r}
# Scale the numeric variables (columns 3:7)
water_scaled <- water_chem %>% 
  select(3:12) %>% 
  scale()
  

# Update to add rownames (country name) from wb_ghg_20
rownames(water_scaled) <- water_chem$site_code

```


```{r}
# Take means from all observations at each site
water_chem$summary <- rowMeans(water_chem[3:12], na.rm = TRUE)

# Create a data frame that has a single summary row per site 
water_sum <- water_chem %>% 
  select(site_code, summary)
```
